    "1. Compare your given name with your nickname (if you donâ€™t have a nickname, invent one for this assignment) by answering the following questions:\n",
    "    - What is the edit distance between your nickname and your given name?\n",
    "    - What is the percentage string match between your nickname and your given name?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find a friend (or family member or classmate) who you know has read a certain book. Without your friend knowing, copy the first two sentences of that book. Now rewrite the words from those sentences, excluding stop words. Now tell your friend to guess which book the words are from by reading them just that list of words. Did you friend correctly guess the book on the first try? What did he or she guess? Explain why you think you friend either was or was not able to guess the book from hearing the list of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run one of the stemmers available in Python. Run the same two sentences from question 2 above through the stemmer and show the results. How many of the outputted stems are valid morphological roots of the corresponding words? Express this answer as a percentage.\n",

    "_Show your work for both calculations (number 2 and 3 above)._\n"
